Being an avid soccer/football and a Manchester United fan, I have taken seasons 2012/13 (Sir Alex Ferguson's last season in charge), 2015/16 (LVG in charge and 3 years of post-SAF era) and 2018/19 (Mourinho/Solksjaer in charge and most recent complete season)
to provide insights into the situation and statistical differences and how manchester united has faired over the last 6 years divided by 3 year intervals.

File league.csv has a list of all premier league match results from the 1800s to the 2018/19 season with names of oppositions, home team goals, away team goals and goal difference, final result, etc

pleague.py contains the code I have written using libraries such as numpy, pandas and matplotlib to manipulate data in league.csv, filter/transform certain fields and plot various types of graphs to provide insights into scoring records, games won, drawn or lost per season and home vs away statistics.

IMPORTANT: Since I am a data visualization enthusiast, I hope you would be able to realize that these statistics provide more insight than just goals scored or games won, a deeper insight into the areas where the team is weak and requires reinforcements!

Have included graph images for viewing:
1) 1.png - Goals scored vs conceded for all 3 seasons and games won, lost or drawn at home during those seasons.

2) 2.png - Goals scored vs conceded for all 3 seasons and games won, lost or drawn away from home during those seasons.

3) 3.png - Goal scoring record for all 3 seasons at home vs away during those seasons.

4) 4.png - Goal scoring record for all 3 seasons at home vs away against top 6 oppositions (Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester City, Tottenham Hotspur) during those seasons.
